## Introduction

I'm currently reading this book called \textit{The Human Network} by Matthew O. Jackson. It's the first book on networks that I have read and its giving me reminders every now and then that I am actually really interested in networks because of the applications of graph theory and how introductory of a data structure they are which makes it a good teaching tool for beginner coders. This repo is simply a little code I (along with the gf Anouska Siva) was inspired to write and a nice practice in data structures. I'm honestly not sure where I would use this code right now but was just urging to write it so here it is.
